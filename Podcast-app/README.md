## Technology

The project is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). It leverages the [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) platform for deployment and [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) for user authentication and database storage.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository_url]`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. I suggest you run the development server using: `npm run dev`

## Deployment

The app was deployed to a custom Netlify url: https://rococo-griffin-70cd2a.netlify.app
